<h1>Heart Disease Prediction Project</h1>
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various medical and lifestyle factors.

<h2>Overview</h2>
Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment and prevention. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset of patient information and build a predictive model to identify individuals at risk of developing heart disease.

<h2>Dataset</h2>
The dataset used in this project is sourced from kaggle dataset repository, containing anonymized patient information including demographics, medical history, and various diagnostic measurements. The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set for model development and evaluation, respectively.

<h2>Project Structure</h2>
data/: Contains the dataset files.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
src/: Source code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
models/: Saved model files.
reports/: Reports and documentation.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
Python 3
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib

<h2>Usage</h2>
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Iam-PriyanshuGupta/heart-disease-prediction.git

Explore Jupyter notebooks in notebooks/ for data analysis and model development.

<h2>Results</h2>
The trained model achieves an accuracy of 89% on the test set.
