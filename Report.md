#Heart Disease Prediction Project Report
##Overview
The Heart Disease Prediction Project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the risk of heart disease in individuals based on various medical and lifestyle factors. The project utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm implemented with the Scikit-learn library. Additionally, it leverages Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy for data manipulation, visualization, and preprocessing. The project achieved an accuracy of 89% in predicting heart disease risk.

##Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains anonymized patient information sourced from kaggle. It includes features such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more.

##Methodology
Data Preprocessing: The dataset underwent preprocessing of quality checks for missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables.

Feature Selection: Relevant features were selected based on their correlation with heart disease risk.

Model Training: The KNN algorithm was trained using Scikit-learn with hyperparameters.

Model Evaluation: The trained model was evaluated on a splited test set, achieving an accuracy of 89%.

##Results
Accuracy: The KNN model achieved an accuracy of 89% in predicting heart disease risk.

Model Interpretation: Further analysis revealed that features such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure were strong indicators of heart disease risk.

##Future Improvements
Feature Engineering: Explore additional features or transformations to improve model performance.

Model Optimization: Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to further enhance accuracy.

Ensemble Methods: Investigate the use of ensemble methods to boost predictive power.

##Conclusion
The Heart Disease Prediction Project successfully developed a machine learning model using the KNN algorithm to predict heart disease risk with an accuracy of 89%. This project demonstrates the potential of leveraging machine learning techniques for early detection and prevention of heart disease, contributing to improved healthcare outcomes.
